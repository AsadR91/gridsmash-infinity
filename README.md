# GridSmash Infinity

A fun and addictive block-based puzzle game inspired by classic games like Tetris and Block Blast. Place blocks strategically on an 8x8 grid, clear lines, and aim for the highest score!

## How to Play

1. **Game Objective**: Place blocks on the grid to create complete rows or columns. When a row or column is filled, it will be cleared, and you'll earn points.

2. **Controls**:
   - Drag and drop pieces onto the grid
   - Right-click a piece to rotate it
   - Click the "Play Again" button when game is over to start a new game

3. **Scoring**:
   - 100 points for each cleared line (row or column)
   - Try to clear multiple lines at once for higher scores!

4. **Game Over**: The game ends when no more pieces can be placed on the grid.

## Technical Details

The game is built using vanilla JavaScript with a modular architecture:

- `index.html`: Main game layout and structure
- `styles.css`: Modern and responsive styling
- `js/main.js`: Core game logic and UI interactions
